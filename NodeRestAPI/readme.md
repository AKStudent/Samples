# Node.js Introduction

## Introduction

I use this sample in Node.js workshops to showcase fundamentals of Node.js development using TypeScript.

You can find more material inclusive additional samples and exercises at [https://rstropek.github.io/htl-mobile-computing/](https://rstropek.github.io/htl-mobile-computing/). This is the material I use when teaching mobile development at the HTL Perg. All the material is open source. Feel free to use and share it as you like.
