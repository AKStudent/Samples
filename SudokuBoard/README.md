I regularly do C# sessions and trainings. I use this sample to demonstrate the following topics:

* Scenario-Driven Development (SDD)
* C# Coding Guidelines
* Framework Design Guidelines
* Visual Studio Code Analysis
* Code Contracts
* Basics of parallel programming with Task Parallel Library (TPL)
* Visual Studio unit testing
* C# code documentation and Sandcastle Helpfile Builder (SHFB)
