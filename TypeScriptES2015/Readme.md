# What's New in TypeScript 1.5?

This folder contains sample I created for an article for the German [Windows Developer](https://entwickler.de/) magazine. It covers:

* TypeScript's new module syntax which is not compatible with ECMAScript 2015
* Destructuring
* The new keywords `let` and `const`
* The new `for..of` loop
* Samples for decorators (will be part of ECMAScript 2016)
* TypeScript's new computed properties syntax
