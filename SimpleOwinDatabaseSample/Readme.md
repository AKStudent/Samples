# Simple OWIN Database Sample

## Introduction

I created this sample for the [OOP 2015](http://www.oop-konferenz.de/oop2015/startseite-englisch/conference.html)
conference in Munich (Germany). My topic is *Application Lifecycle Management in the Cloud*.
As always I try to show mostly practical samples instead of boring slides. 
This sample code should allow participants to reproduce my demos and play with the
results.

## Content of the Sample

I have written a detailed blog article describing the background of the sample.
You can find it [in my blog](http://www.software-architects.com/devblog/2015/01/27/OOP-2015-ALM-in-the-Cloud-with-Visual-Studio-Online-and-Azure).
