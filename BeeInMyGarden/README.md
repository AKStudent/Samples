# Bee in my Garden Sample 

Originally I developed this sample for my session at Microsoft TechEd 2013. I talked about building in the cloud
with Team Foundation Services. In 2014 I was invited to do an updated version of the session at ALM-Days in Germany.
I use the session to demonstrate the following topics:

* [Windows Azure Websites](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/services/web-sites/)
* [Visual Studio Online](http://www.visualstudio.com/)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) integration in Visual Studio 2013
  
## Prerequisites to play with the sample

* Visual Studio 2013
* [Visual Studio Online](http://www.visualstudio.com/) account
* [Windows Azure](http://www.windowsazure.com/) account
