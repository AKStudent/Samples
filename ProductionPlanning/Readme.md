# Production Planning Sample

Creator: Rainer Stropek, Azure MVP

Originally created for C# Workshop at [BASTA Spring 2015 conference](https://basta.net).

## Scope

I use this sample to introduce some new features of C# 6. Additionally, it demonstrates
how to build an immutable SDK based on 
[System.Collections.Immutable](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Collections.Immutable/).
For the BASTA workshop, immutables are importable as we will talk about Roslyn, too. Roslyn's
API uses immutables all over the place. This sample should demonstrate the participants
how immutability works and why it has advantages.
